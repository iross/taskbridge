## Description

Build the Linear API client to fetch projects and issues, with support for the #client/CLIENT_NAME label convention

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Functions implemented: get_projects()
- [x] create_project(name)
- [x] get_issues(project_id, query)
- [x] Parses #client/CLIENT_NAME format from project labels correctly
- [x] API authentication handled with proper error responses
- [x] Request/response logging for debugging

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement LinearAPI class with GraphQL authentication headers
2. Add get_projects() method to fetch all Linear projects
3. Add create_project(name) method to create new projects
4. Add get_issues(project_id, query) method for issue searching
5. Implement #client/CLIENT_NAME label parsing logic
6. Add proper error handling and logging
7. Test API client with real/mock data

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented Linear API client with complete functionality: get_projects(), create_project(), get_issues() with filtering, #client/CLIENT_NAME label parsing, proper GraphQL authentication, error handling, and CLI integration. Includes comprehensive data classes and request/response handling.
