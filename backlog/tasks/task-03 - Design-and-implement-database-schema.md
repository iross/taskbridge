## Description

Create SQLite database schema for project mappings and sync logging

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Database stored at ~/.taskbridge/mappings.db
- [x] Projects table with all required fields (linear_id toggl_client_id etc.)
- [x] Sync log table for tracking operations
- [x] Database migrations and initialization handled automatically
- [x] CRUD operations implemented in database.py

## Implementation Plan

1. Design SQLite database schema for projects and sync_log tables
2. Implement database.py with SQLite connection and initialization
3. Create migration system for database schema updates
4. Implement CRUD operations for projects table
5. Implement logging operations for sync_log table
6. Test database operations and edge cases

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented SQLite database schema with projects and sync_log tables, complete CRUD operations, automatic database initialization, and proper indexing for performance. Includes data classes for type safety and comprehensive logging capabilities.
