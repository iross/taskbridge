## Description

Build the core sync logic to maintain project mappings between Linear and Toggl with preview and user confirmation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Parses Linear projects to extract Client/Project structure from #client/CLIENT_NAME format
- [x] Compares existing mappings with current API state and identifies changes
- [x] Generates preview of all changes (creates, conflicts, edge cases) before execution
- [x] Handles projects not following #client/CLIENT_NAME pattern by showing them for user decision
- [x] Updates database mappings after user confirms changes
- [x] Supports bidirectional project creation between Linear and Toggl

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement SyncEngine class with analyze_sync_state() method
2. Add preview_sync() method to show planned changes without execution
3. Add execute_sync() method with confirmation and dry-run support
4. Implement logic to parse #client/CLIENT_NAME format from Linear projects
5. Handle bidirectional sync: create Toggl clients/projects from Linear
6. Update database mappings after successful sync operations
7. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
8. Integrate with CLI sync command with options

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented complete synchronization engine with SyncEngine class, analyze_sync_state(), preview_sync(), and execute_sync() methods. Handles #client/CLIENT_NAME parsing, bidirectional sync between Linear and Toggl, database mapping updates, comprehensive error handling, and CLI integration with dry-run and preview options.
