## Description

Add configuration support for Obsidian vault path and note organization settings to enable task-specific note creation. Projects should be manifested as a directory within `/Users/iross/obsidian/obsidian/10\ Projects`. Add an option for creating task-specific notes within these directories. Add frontmatter to the task notes:

---
fileClass: task
project: <name of project>
status: backlog
client: <client of project>
tags: []
due: 
---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Configuration accepts Obsidian vault path setting
- [x] Projects create directories under '/Users/iross/obsidian/obsidian/10 Projects'
- [x] Task-specific notes can be created within project directories
- [x] Generated notes include required frontmatter (fileClass: task project client status tags due)
- [x] Configuration validates vault path exists before use
- [x] System can generate and open Obsidian URL when starting a task (obsidian://open?vault=obsidian&file=...)

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing configuration and codebase structure\n2. Add Obsidian vault configuration to config system\n3. Implement project directory creation under '/Users/iross/obsidian/obsidian/10 Projects'\n4. Add task-specific note creation with required frontmatter\n5. Implement Obsidian URL generation and opening functionality\n6. Add path validation for vault configuration\n7. Test all functionality end-to-end

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive Obsidian vault integration with the following features:

**Configuration Support**: Added vault path and name configuration with validation
- Extended Config class with Obsidian-specific methods
- Added  CLI command for interactive setup
- Vault path validation ensures directory exists before saving

**Project Directory Creation**: Implemented automatic directory structure creation  
- Creates '/Users/iross/obsidian/obsidian/10 Projects/<project_name>' directories
- Handles nested directory creation with proper permissions

**Task Note Generation**: Full task-specific note creation with frontmatter
- Generates markdown files with YAML frontmatter containing fileClass, project, client, status, tags, and due fields
- Sanitizes filenames for filesystem compatibility
- Creates structured note content with task title as heading

**Obsidian URL Integration**: Complete URL generation and opening functionality
- Generates proper obsidian:// URLs with vault name and URL-encoded file paths
- Cross-platform note opening (macOS 'open', Linux 'xdg-open')
- Graceful fallback to URL display if opening fails

**Timer Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing start timer workflow
- Automatically creates notes when starting timers for mapped projects
- Extracts client information from Linear project labels
- Opens created notes directly in Obsidian for immediate use

**Files Modified**:
- src/taskbridge/config.py: Extended with Obsidian functionality
- src/taskbridge/main.py: Added CLI command and timer integration

All acceptance criteria verified through testing. Ready for production use.
