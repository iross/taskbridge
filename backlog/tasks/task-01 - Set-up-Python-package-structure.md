## Description

Create the foundational pip-installable Python package structure for TaskBridge with proper entry points

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Package can be installed with uv/pip from pyproject.toml
- [x] Entry point for taskbridge command is configured
- [x] Directory structure matches PRD specification (src/taskbridge/ with all required modules)
- [x] Package dependencies are properly defined (typer requests pyyaml)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create pyproject.toml with package metadata and dependencies
2. Set up src/taskbridge/ directory structure with __init__.py
3. Create main.py with entry point function
4. Configure CLI entry point in pyproject.toml
5. Test package installation and command availability

## Implementation Notes

Successfully created Python package structure with pyproject.toml, configured entry points, and set up src/taskbridge/ directory with all required modules. Package installs correctly with pip and taskbridge command is available with all CLI commands defined.
